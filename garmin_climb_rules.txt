GARMIN CLIMB DETECTION RULES
============================

This document outlines the climb detection criteria used in the 220 Cycling Analysis Tool,
which are based on Garmin's climb detection algorithm.

OVERVIEW
--------
A climb is considered significant if it meets ALL of the following criteria:
- Minimum horizontal distance: 300 meters
- Minimum elevation gain: 10 meters  
- Average gradient: ≥3%

DETAILED CRITERIA
-----------------

1. MINIMUM CLIMB DISTANCE
   - Value: 300 meters
   - Description: The horizontal distance of the climb must be at least 300 meters
   - Purpose: Filters out short, steep sections that aren't true climbs

2. MINIMUM ELEVATION GAIN
   - Value: 10 meters
   - Description: The total elevation gain from start to end of climb
   - Purpose: Ensures the climb has meaningful vertical gain

3. MINIMUM AVERAGE GRADIENT
   - Value: 3.0%
   - Description: The average gradient over the entire climb must be ≥3%
   - Calculation: (elevation_gain / climb_distance) * 100
   - Purpose: Distinguishes climbs from gradual inclines

4. GRADIENT SMOOTHING
   - Method: 10-point moving average
   - Purpose: Reduces noise in gradient calculations
   - Implementation: Uses rolling window with center=True

5. DESCENT ALLOWANCE WITHIN CLIMBS
   - Maximum cumulative descent: 5 meters
   - Description: Allows small descents within a climb without ending it
   - Purpose: Handles undulating climbs with minor downhills

6. FLAT SECTION THRESHOLD
   - Value: 1.0%
   - Description: Gradients below 1% are considered flat
   - Purpose: Allows flat sections within climbs without ending them

CLIMB DETECTION ALGORITHM
-------------------------

1. GRADIENT CALCULATION
   - Calculate gradient between consecutive data points
   - Formula: gradient = (altitude_diff / distance_diff) * 100
   - Apply 10-point moving average smoothing

2. CLIMB START DETECTION
   - Trigger: When smoothed gradient ≥ 3.0%
   - Reset cumulative descent counter
   - Mark start index

3. CLIMB CONTINUATION RULES
   - Strong climbing (gradient ≥ 3%): Continue climb, reset descent counter
   - Flat section (1% ≤ gradient < 3%): Continue climb, don't update end point
   - Descending (gradient < 0%): Add to cumulative descent
   - If cumulative descent > 5m: End climb

4. CLIMB END DETECTION
   - When cumulative descent exceeds 5 meters
   - When gradient drops below 1% for extended period
   - At end of ride data

5. VALIDATION
   - Verify minimum distance (300m)
   - Verify minimum elevation gain (10m)
   - Verify minimum average gradient (3%)
   - Calculate final metrics if all criteria met

CALCULATED METRICS
------------------

For each valid climb, the following metrics are calculated:

- start_idx: Index where climb begins
- end_idx: Index where climb ends  
- distance: Climb distance in meters
- elevation_gain: Total elevation gain in meters
- avg_gradient: Average gradient as percentage
- max_gradient: Maximum gradient as percentage
- start_distance: Distance from ride start in km
- duration: Climb duration in minutes
- avg_power: Average power during climb (if available)
- max_power: Maximum power during climb (if available)
- avg_hr: Average heart rate during climb (if available)
- max_hr: Maximum heart rate during climb (if available)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
-------------------

- The algorithm processes data point by point
- Uses potential end points to handle flat sections within climbs
- Handles edge cases like rides ending during climbs
- Provides comprehensive metrics for climb analysis
- Integrates with power and heart rate data when available
