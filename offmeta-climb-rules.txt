OFF-META CLIMB DETECTION RULES
==============================

This document outlines alternative climb detection criteria that relax the standard
Garmin rules to capture climbs that might be missed by the stricter criteria.
These "off-meta" rules are designed to identify climbs that are meaningful to
riders but don't meet the official Garmin climb detection standards.

OVERVIEW
--------
Off-meta climbs are identified using relaxed criteria that capture:
- Shorter but steeper climbs
- Longer but gentler climbs  
- Climbs with more descent allowance
- Climbs that start/end differently than Garmin expects

PRIMARY OFF-META CRITERIA
-------------------------

A climb is considered significant under off-meta rules if it meets ANY of the
following criteria sets:

SET 1: SHORT BUT STEEP CLIMBS
- Minimum horizontal distance: 150 meters (vs 300m Garmin)
- Minimum elevation gain: 8 meters (vs 10m Garmin)
- Average gradient: ≥4% (vs 3% Garmin)
- Purpose: Captures short, punchy climbs common in urban riding

SET 2: LONG BUT GENTLE CLIMBS
- Minimum horizontal distance: 500 meters (vs 300m Garmin)
- Minimum elevation gain: 15 meters (vs 10m Garmin)
- Average gradient: ≥2% (vs 3% Garmin)
- Purpose: Captures long, gradual climbs that feel significant

SET 3: UNDULATING CLIMBS
- Minimum horizontal distance: 400 meters (vs 300m Garmin)
- Minimum elevation gain: 12 meters (vs 10m Garmin)
- Average gradient: ≥2.5% (vs 3% Garmin)
- Maximum cumulative descent: 10 meters (vs 5m Garmin)
- Purpose: Captures climbs with rolling terrain

SET 4: URBAN/STOP-START CLIMBS
- Minimum horizontal distance: 200 meters (vs 300m Garmin)
- Minimum elevation gain: 6 meters (vs 10m Garmin)
- Average gradient: ≥3.5% (vs 3% Garmin)
- Allows for traffic stops (speed < 1 m/s for up to 30 seconds)
- Purpose: Captures climbs interrupted by traffic lights

DETAILED OFF-META PARAMETERS
----------------------------

1. RELAXED DISTANCE THRESHOLDS
   - Short climbs: 150m minimum
   - Standard climbs: 200m minimum
   - Long climbs: 400-500m minimum
   - Purpose: Accommodate different riding environments

2. RELAXED ELEVATION GAIN THRESHOLDS
   - Minimum: 6 meters (vs 10m Garmin)
   - Standard: 8-12 meters
   - Long climbs: 15+ meters
   - Purpose: Capture climbs that feel significant despite modest elevation

3. RELAXED GRADIENT THRESHOLDS
   - Gentle climbs: ≥2% (vs 3% Garmin)
   - Standard climbs: ≥2.5-3.5%
   - Steep climbs: ≥4%
   - Purpose: Include gradual climbs that are still challenging

4. INCREASED DESCENT ALLOWANCE
   - Standard: 8 meters (vs 5m Garmin)
   - Undulating: 10-12 meters
   - Mountain climbs: 15 meters
   - Purpose: Handle complex terrain with multiple small descents

5. RELAXED FLAT SECTION THRESHOLD
   - Value: 0.5% (vs 1% Garmin)
   - Purpose: Allow more flat sections within climbs

6. TRAFFIC-AWARE DETECTION
   - Allows speed drops to <1 m/s for up to 30 seconds
   - Continues climb detection after traffic stops
   - Purpose: Handle urban riding with traffic lights

OFF-META CLIMB CATEGORIES
-------------------------

1. PUNCHY CLIMBS
   - Distance: 150-300m
   - Gradient: 4-8%
   - Elevation: 8-20m
   - Typical: Short, steep sections in urban areas

2. GRADUAL CLIMBS
   - Distance: 500m-2km
   - Gradient: 2-3%
   - Elevation: 15-60m
   - Typical: Long, gentle inclines on country roads

3. ROLLING CLIMBS
   - Distance: 400m-1km
   - Gradient: 2.5-4%
   - Elevation: 12-40m
   - Descent allowance: 10m
   - Typical: Undulating terrain with small descents

4. URBAN CLIMBS
   - Distance: 200-500m
   - Gradient: 3.5-6%
   - Elevation: 6-25m
   - Traffic-aware: Yes
   - Typical: City streets with traffic interruptions

5. MOUNTAIN CLIMBS
   - Distance: 1km+
   - Gradient: 3-8%
   - Elevation: 50m+
   - Descent allowance: 15m
   - Typical: Extended climbs in mountainous terrain

IMPLEMENTATION SUGGESTIONS
-------------------------

1. MULTI-TIER DETECTION
   - Run Garmin rules first
   - Run off-meta rules on remaining sections
   - Combine results with clear labeling

2. CONFIDENCE SCORING
   - Garmin climbs: 100% confidence
   - Off-meta climbs: 60-90% confidence based on criteria match
   - Display confidence level in results

3. CATEGORIZATION
   - Label climbs as "Garmin" or "Off-meta"
   - Sub-categorize off-meta climbs by type
   - Provide reasoning for classification

4. VISUALIZATION
   - Different colors for Garmin vs off-meta climbs
   - Confidence indicators in plots
   - Separate summary sections

ADVANTAGES OF OFF-META RULES
----------------------------

1. INCLUSIVITY
   - Captures climbs meaningful to different riding styles
   - Accommodates various terrain types
   - Recognizes urban riding challenges

2. FLEXIBILITY
   - Adapts to local riding conditions
   - Handles different fitness levels
   - Considers subjective difficulty

3. COMPREHENSIVENESS
   - Provides complete climb analysis
   - Captures edge cases missed by strict rules
   - Offers multiple perspectives on ride difficulty

DISADVANTAGES AND CONSIDERATIONS
-------------------------------

1. SUBJECTIVITY
   - Less standardized than Garmin rules
   - May include sections some riders don't consider climbs
   - Requires careful parameter tuning

2. COMPLEXITY
   - Multiple rule sets to maintain
   - More complex implementation
   - Potential for conflicting detections

3. VALIDATION
   - Harder to validate against established standards
   - May require user feedback for tuning
   - Risk of false positives

RECOMMENDED USAGE
-----------------

1. COMPLEMENTARY ANALYSIS
   - Use alongside Garmin rules, not as replacement
   - Provide both perspectives to users
   - Let users choose which climbs to focus on

2. CONTEXT-AWARE APPLICATION
   - Apply different rule sets based on ride type
   - Urban rides: Favor traffic-aware rules
   - Mountain rides: Favor extended climb rules
   - Mixed terrain: Use comprehensive approach

3. USER CUSTOMIZATION
   - Allow users to adjust thresholds
   - Provide preset configurations for different riding styles
   - Enable/disable specific rule sets
